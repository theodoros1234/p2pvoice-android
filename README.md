# P2PVoice for Android

Peer to peer video and audio communication between two Android devices, without the need for any mobile infrastructure

For Opus audio encoding/decoding, it uses the [theeasiestway/android-opus-codec](https://github.com/theeasiestway/android-opus-codec) library, which is a wrapper around [libopus](https://opus-codec.org/release/stable/2019/04/12/libopus-1_3_1.html).

**WARNING:** This app is in early development, and may never be fully developed. DO NOT USE for anything important!
